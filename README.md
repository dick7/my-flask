# The Minimal Flask APP

# To run the application
  
  use the *flask* command or *python -m flask*. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the **FLASK_APP** environment variable:
``` 
$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
